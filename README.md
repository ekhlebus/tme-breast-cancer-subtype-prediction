Immune Landscape–Based Prediction of Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes. Subtype Classification Based on CIBERSORT Immune Fractions. 

Here we evaluate whether immune cell composition alone is sufficient to distinguish clinically relevant cancer subtypes.

🎯 Binary classification definition (important decision)

To keep this industry-clean and statistically stable, we’ll do:

Basal-like vs Luminal (A + B)

Why this is the best binary setup:

Basal-like ≈ triple-negative (clinically important)

Luminal A/B ≈ hormone receptor–positive

Strong immune differences → CIBERSORT makes sense

Balanced enough for ML

Very common in real publications and industry work
